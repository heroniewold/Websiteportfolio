        <h1 id="numbertwo">Guest Lecture - Analyzing Kluppie by the KNVB</h1>
    <p >
        Research done showed that a lot of children move less nowadays and a quarter of children are even under the needed moving norm. Because movement is one of the best things for physical and c
        ognitive development the KNVB came up with Kluppie. Kluppie is a weekly activity after school meant to combine sport lessons and playing outside. This way children learn multiple forms of sport, 
        but also get the freedom to have fun on their own terms, by playing with friends or doing the activities they want to do. Although the concept in itself is interesting, it’s difficult to motivate 
        kids in this modern era to participate in these kinds of activities. That’s why Kluppie has a personal mascot, within this mascot is also a personal mascot for the children themselves. Using a 
        pedometer the mascot can get new items (like clothing) and start growing, representing the physical development the kids go trough. <br /><br />
Using a digital solution to make sports a more interesting aspect for kids is a really nice solution in modern times, because you connect the huge modern development we can’t avoid and 
combine it with positive goals. I myself find this project really interesting because I’ve been struggling with going outside since having access to computers, games and the like. I see this 
as a negative development, because although the huge mass of things we can do with technology nowadays is really impressive, nothing beats being outside, active and enjoying nature. If a project like
 this shows success I believe more projects will show up, using modern technology to tackle problems caused by technology.
